The class is comprised of mostly first year graduate students, many of whom are just getting their feet wet with R programming.\n\nI was tasked with reviewing some of the basic `dplyr` functions as well as briefly introducing the students to the concept of **tidy data** and the `pivot_longer()` function.\n\nI created the slides for this review session with R markdown and the `xaringan`, `xaringanthemer`, `xaringanExtra`, and `DT` packages. I used a [Tidy Tuesday dataset from the American Kennel Club](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2022/2022-02-01/readme.md) about dog breeds and their associated traits. The ordinal data made it easier for students to filter the dataset based on different traits to identify their 'ideal dog'.\n\nMy slides are below!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"shareagain\" style=\"min-width:300px;margin:1em auto;\" data-exeternal=\"1\">\n<iframe src=\"wrangle_pivot_TAsession.html\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" style=\"border:2px solid currentColor;\" loading=\"lazy\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<script>fitvids('.shareagain', {players: 'iframe'});</script>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
