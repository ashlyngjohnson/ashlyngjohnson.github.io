Biological Sciences, North Carolina State University, 2017\n\nConcentration: Integrative Physiology and Neurobiology\nMinors: Cognitive Science and Biotechnology\n\nPh.D. Neuroscience, Emory University, In Progress\n\nAdviser: Dr. Chad Hales MD, PhD\nPublications\n\nCertificates\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy day,\nI study the role of astrocytes in frontotemporal dementia associated with tau pathology - with a particular interest in the astrocyte endfoot. I combine classical biochemical techniques with proteomic and transcriptomic approaches to dissect the impact of mutant tau on the gliovascular unit. Through this project, I’ve discovered a passion for data visualization and R programming.\nBy night,\nI’m bolstering my data skills. My time in graduate school has taught me that the parts of research that I enjoy most are data analysis and visualization with R. I am happiest when I get to tinker with code to make the perfect graph. Thus, I’m broadening my skill set by advancing in R as well as learning SQL and python.\nEarning a PhD comes with a unique set of skills including how to ask good questions, design experiments to answer those questions, and to think critically about results and their impact on the field.\nAfter graduation, I will leverage my scientific background and my data toolbox to solve problems and generate insights as a data professional."

I used a Tidy Tuesday dataset from the American Kennel Club about dog breeds and their associated traits. The ordinal data made it easier for students to filter the dataset based on different traits to identify their ‘ideal dog’.\nMy slides are below!"
