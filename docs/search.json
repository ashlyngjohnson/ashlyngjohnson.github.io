Biological Sciences, North Carolina State University, 2017\n\n\nConcentration: Integrative Physiology and Neurobiology\nMinors: Cognitive Science and Biotechnology\n\n\nPh.D. Neuroscience, Emory University, In Progress\n\n\nAdviser: Dr. Chad Hales MD, PhD\nPublications\n\n\nCertificates\n\n\nGoogle Data Analytics Certificate (4/8 courses completed)\n\n\n\nBy day,\n\nI study the role of astrocytes in frontotemporal dementia associated with tau pathology - with a particular interest in the astrocyte endfoot. I combine classical biochemical techniques with proteomic and transcriptomic approaches to dissect the impact of mutant tau on the gliovascular unit. Through this project, I’ve discovered a passion for data visualization and R programming.\n\nBy night,\n\nI’m bolstering my data skills. My time in graduate school has taught me that the parts of research that I enjoy most are data analysis and visualization with R. I am happiest when I get to tinker with code o make the perfect graph. Thus, I’m broadening my skill set by advancing in R as well as learning SQL and python.\nEarning a PhD comes with a unique set of skills including how to ask good questions, design experiments to answer those questions, and to think critically about results and their impact on the field.\n\nAfter graduation, I will leverage my scientific background and my data toolbox to solve problems and generate insights as a data professional."
