Recently, I gave a short presentation to students in **IBS 519: Introduction to Data Analysis** at Emory University. Many of these students are first year graduate students and most are just starting to learn R programming. The class primarily uses R Studio Cloud to distribute assignments and manage the computing environment - which has worked well for the classroom. However, once the class ends, the students will only have access to the free tier of R Studio Cloud - which isn't sufficient for students who join primarily computational laboratories.

Thus, the other teaching assistants and I decided to briefly introduce the concept of installing R and R studio locally. We also thought about important data management principles that early graduate students should be aware of and decided to highlight R projects, file management, and version control. This slide deck is meant to be a high level overview of these concepts with some links to resources that are helpful for further study.

I created the slides for this presentation with R markdown and the `xaringan`, `xaringanthemer`, and `xaringanExtra` packages.

My slides are below!

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(xaringanExtra)
embed_xaringan(
  url = "rlocal_projects_slides.html",
  ratio = "16:9",
  border = "2px solid currentColor",
  max_width = NULL,
  margin = "1em auto",
  style = NULL
)
```
