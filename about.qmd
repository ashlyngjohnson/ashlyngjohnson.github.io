I study the role of astrocytes in frontotemporal dementia associated with tau pathology - with a particular interest in the astrocyte endfoot. I combine classical biochemical techniques with proteomic and transcriptomic approaches to dissect the impact of mutant tau on the gliovascular unit. Through this project, I've discovered a passion for data visualization and R programming.

I'm bolstering my data skills. My time in graduate school has taught me that the parts of research that I enjoy most are data analysis and visualization with R. I am happiest when I get to tinker with code to make the perfect graph. Thus, I'm broadening my skill set by advancing in R as well as learning SQL and python.

Earning a PhD comes with a unique set of skills including how to *ask good questions*, *design experiments* to answer those questions, and to *think critically* about results and their impact on the field.

[**After graduation, I will leverage my scientific background and my data toolbox to solve problems and generate insights as a data professional.**]{style="color:#2AA198;"}
